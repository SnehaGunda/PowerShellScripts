<# Second Sample Runbook
.SYNOPSIS
    Connects to Azure and starts of all VMs in the specified Azure subscription

.DESCRIPTION
   This runbook sample demonstrates how to connect to Azure using organization id credential
   based authentication. Before using this runbook, you must create an Azure Active Directory
   user and allow that user to manage the Azure subscription you want to work against. You must
   also place this user's username / password in an Azure Automation credential asset.
   
   You can find more information on configuring Azure so that Azure Automation can manage your
   Azure subscription(s) here: http://aka.ms/Sspv1l

   After configuring Azure and creating the Azure Automation credential asset, make sure to
   update this runbook to contain your Azure subscription name and credential asset name.

   This runbook can be scheduled to start all VMs at a certain time of day.  When creating schedule assets,
   use every 7 days as the interval to create a scheduled start for each desired work day.  i.e. Every Monday at 7am,
